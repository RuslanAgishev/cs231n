- Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

  The IPython Notebook [knn.ipynb](https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb)
  will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.
  
- Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine

  The IPython Notebook [svm.ipynb](https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/cs231n/tree/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb)
  will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.
  
- Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier

  The IPython Notebook [softmax.ipynb](https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/cs231n/tree/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb)
  will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.
  
- Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network

  The IPython Notebook [two_layer_net.ipynb](https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/cs231n/tree/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
  will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.
  
- Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features
  The IPython Notebook [features.ipynb](https://github.com/RuslanAgishev/cs231n/tree/master/assignment1/features.ipynb)
  will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained
  by    using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
